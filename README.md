# Galactic-Shooter
The game is a space shooter where the player controls a spacecraft using their mouse. The objective is to destroy as many enemies as possible while avoiding collisions with them. The player can shoot projectiles to destroy enemies. Enemies appear from the right side of the screen and move towards the left. If an enemy reaches the left edge of the screen without being destroyed, the player loses the game.

The game offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. The difficulty affects the speed of enemies and how frequently they appear.

The player can also return to the main menu at any time during the game. Once the player loses by allowing an enemy to touch the edge of the screen, they see a defeat screen displaying their score and have the option to return to the main menu to start a new game.

The player's score is displayed at the top right of the screen during the game and is updated each time an enemy is destroyed. This allows the player to track their progress and try to improve their score with each playthrough.
